# linksaas intro
As the information hub of the software R&D team, Liiksaas connects the tools and information needed in the R&D process, so as to achieve efficient communication, knowledge precipitation and reasonable evaluation in the R&D process.

Linksaas is used in working scenarios, and we only provide PC-based clients at present. We used the [Tauri](https://tauri.studio) framework for development, and the client can run on Windows,macOs, and Linux.

## Use Linksaas for efficient communication

In keeping with the custom of software development, we organize information by project, and we can create multiple channels within the project to communicate different matters.

Keeping team members focused and in flow during development is key to effective development.

We have kept extreme restraint in the process of information transmission. We have graded the information. The data generated by the machine (user behavior, third-party webhook, etc.) will be put into the work record plate, and the direct communication between people will be carried out in the channel. Only when a member is explicitly mentioned in the communication process will we give a strong reminder, and if the user is in focus mode, it will also become a weak reminder.

In Linksaas, you can easily understand the status of team members, including what work has been done, what work is being done, and what work will be done. We also integrated information from third-party development systems and tied this information to team members to ensure that the work status was comprehensive. With a comprehensive understanding of the working status of team members, we can arrange work and communicate more purposefully.

To prevent invalid communication, channel creators and administrators can turn off channels and make them read-only. Usually we can turn off the channel when we have a definite conclusion on something.

## Use Linksaas for knowledge precipitation

Documentation requires significant maintenance costs in software development teams, essentially because document content is static and isolated.

We want the documentation to be small but precise, linked to the environment, and updated by code or automated processes. Documentation is subordinate to the project, and under each project there is a document version that is used to maintain documentation for the current project. We provide components for project management, project analysis, software design, external data acquisition, and knowledge consolidation to minimize the overhead of maintaining documentation.

Documentation also allows users to reorganize software functionality and information to contain all the information about an item in a single document. For example, in a development plan, you can define development cycles, key nodes, personnel responsibilities, reference tasks/defects, code repository information acquisition, and components of software design classes. The development cycle component allows you to dynamically see the current time versus key nodes, reference tasks/defects allows you to see how many things have been done, the code repository information capture allows you to see the latest code commit, and the software interface component allows you to debug the interface directly on the document. Team members can get the most complete and up-to-date information on relevant issues in a single document.

A variable content block is a component that is modified by an external tool through an API. It currently supports plain text, HTML, and Markdown formats. Updates are typically delivered to documents in a build tool, automation system, or monitoring system. Variable content blocks can be embedded within a document to display externally up-to-date information.

## Use Linksaas for reasonable evaluation

To prevent evaluation bias, we provide an anonymous evaluation system that is evaluated by the whole team.

The work record is the key to reasonable evaluation. In the future, we will provide a set of analysis framework for analyzing the behavior data of members.

## Open and win-win, let every R&D staff use Linksaas

At present, we open all the source code except the server, and anyone can modify the software in accordance with the open source protocol. We will open the server application to cloud service vendors, so that customers who care about data privacy can deploy on their own cloud.

After the Linksaas tool is gradually improved, we will focus on connecting some efficiency tools, good developers, and good community content for software projects.

# Q&A

### How do I compile software?

1. [install tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) 
2. Run the following command

      
```bash
   yarn install
   yarn tauri build
```

### Linksaas is the charging software?

Currently in the software testing phase, the software does not charge. In the future, we will charge for value-added services and keep basic functions free.

Value-added services include:

1. Help the R&D team to build an appropriate R&D system
2. Help R&D team find excellent talents
3. Assisted the R&D team in personnel evaluation
